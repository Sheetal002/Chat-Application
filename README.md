# Chat-Application

 The chat application is designed to allow multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages with each other in real-time. 
 It follows the client-server architecture, where the server acts as a central hub for message distribution, and clients connect to the server to send and receive messages.  
 
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are employed to structure the codebase.   
 Socket programming is utilized for network communication between the server and clients. Java's Socket and ServerSocket classes are employed to establish connections and transfer data between the server and clients. The server runs on a specific port and listens for incoming connections from clients. 
 Once a client connects to the server, it can send and receive messages through the established socket connections.
